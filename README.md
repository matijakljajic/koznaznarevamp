A small project done in Python for one of the uni courses. 
Let's call it a subfork of a Serbian TV show adapted for hosting pub quizes in Serbian.

Inspired by [Nenad Ilić](https://github.com/ilic5000) and his [pub quiz generator](https://github.com/ilic5000/pabkvizgenerator) made with the Anansi crawler.

*Some questions have issues because Anansi interpreted them in a wrong way but this can be fixed gradually with the report system I did (~~I intend to do~~)*

## Progress

- [x] Basic functionality
- [x] Basic UI and art
- [x] System intended for issue reporting
- [ ] Points system used in tandem with NLP library recognising if the typed answer is indeed correct


## Thought process

- Basic functionality is based upon ***qnagen.py***.
- Basic UI and art is something else to say the least. I used pygame and couple more libraries in combination with the art from the actual tv show. The whole project could have been done a lot faster if I used something else and not pygame. Will use Python just for scripts in the future - would rather use some other language for the GUI/UI etc.
- Issue reporting works using Discord webhooks (~~mail~~). If an issue with a question/answer has been found, the user can notify me to change it in the excel sheet in due time over a button.


## How to run

### Regular installation

- Download the latest release over the download button at the top of this README
- Install the program (It's preferable if you leave the default installation location, you can unistall over control panel later if you want)
- Run

### Over code

- If on Windows, execute run.bat to install needed libraries
- If on Linux/Mac, execute run.sh to install needed libraries
- Open game.py and run
