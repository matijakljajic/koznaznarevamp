  </p>

A small project done in Python for one of the uni courses. 
Let's call it a subfork of a Serbian TV show adapted for hosting pub quizes.

Inspired by [Nenad IliÄ‡](https://github.com/ilic5000) and his [pub quiz generator](https://github.com/ilic5000/pabkvizgenerator) made with the Anansi crawler.

*Some questions have issues because Anansi interpreted them in a wrong way, this can be fixed with the report system I did (~~I intend to do~~)*

## Progress

- [x] Basic functionality
- [x] Basic UI and art
- [x] System intended for issue reporting


## Thought process

- Basic functionality is based upon ***qnagen.py***.
- Basic UI and art is something else to say the least. I used pygame and couple more libraries in combination with the art from the actual tv show. The whole project could have been done a lot faster if I used something else and not pygame. Will use Python just for scripts in the future - would rather use some other language for the GUI/UI etc.
- Issue reporting works purely over mail. Users don't have to register or anything. If an issue with a question/answer has been found, the user can notify me to change it in the excel sheet over a button.
