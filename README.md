  </p>

A small project done in Python for one of the uni courses. 
Let's call it a subfork of a Serbian TV show adapted for hosting pub quizes.

Inspired by [Nenad IliÄ‡](https://github.com/ilic5000) and his [pub quiz generator](https://github.com/ilic5000/pabkvizgenerator) made with the Anansi crawler.

*Some questions have issues because Anansi interpreted them in a wrong way, this can be fixed with the report system I intend to do*

## Progress

- [x] Basic functionality
- [ ] Basic UI and art
- [ ] System intended for issue reporting
